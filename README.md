# Posts for the ONHB

Simple Vue App which allows for the creation of images for social media posts for the Olimpíada Nacional em História do Brasil (ONHB, or Brazilian National History Olympiad). 

Since each edition has a specific graphical scheme, this can be set (starting from the 2020, 12th edition, and including the special “Pandemic Edition” of the ONHB and also a neutral, more general option).

Images can be created according to the dimensions for Instagram (regular feed and stories), Twitter, and Facebook.
